## Course Scheduling POC
This project is a proof of concept. The goal is to solve a course scheduling problem with a constraint solving
framework. In this case we have used Choco (http://www.choco-solver.org).

You should be provided with the following documentation files:

* Documentation_CourseScheduling_Choco.pdf (or .docx)
* Abb.1_search_tree.png
* Abb.2_index_view.png
* Abb.3_row_view.png
* Abb.4_credit_points.png
* Abb.5_set_view.png

Note: This is a gradle project which uses a maven repo as the source for the choco-solver libs.

Have fun :)
